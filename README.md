# ThoughtBin Server

ThoughtBin allows users to anonymously share and create content on a simple and frictionless micro-platform. Think of it as a privacy-centric Twitter with a hint of 4Chan. A live demo can be found at [https://thoughtbin.imdan.io/](https://thoughtbin.imdan.io/)

## Motivation

I wanted a social media network where I didn't have to worry about followers, likes, or reputation. I felt there was a need to create something that respected the user and fostered a safe space for self-expression. Soon after, the idea of ThoughtBin was born. 

ThoughtBin's basic principles:

* Disseminating information shouldnâ€™t be difficult
* Publishing new information should not require you to surrender your identity
* Access to information should not be gated by identification
* Every internet user should have the ability to *anonymously* share/create content; *pseudonymity* is not acceptable.

By design, ThoughtBin only stores a single token in Local Storage to authenticate and fetch your personal thoughts. No trackers, no cookies, nothing else.

## ThoughtBot

The live demo includes an automated posting bot that scrapes r/ShowerThoughts to feign user interaction and show off the WebSocket functionality + infinite scroll features. Here is the repository for [ThoughtBot](https://github.com/dannydi12/thoughtbin-bot).

## Installation

#### `npm install`

Installs all the required dependencies. Run this before anything else.

#### `npm run migrate`

Uses postgrator to create required tables. Create a database and edit `postgrator-config.js`  before running this command.

#### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.

#### `npm test`

Launches Mocha.

#### `npm start`

Launches the server at the post specified in your `.env` file.

## Configuration

Make sure to go to `[thoughtbin-folder-name]/example.env` , rename it to `.env`, and then enter your configuration details (port, Postgres database URL, etc)
